## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
file_path <- "D:/OneDrive - University of Virginia/Will M/Undergraduate Research Courses-Grants/Summer 2025/Introduction to Regression Analysis (STAT 3220)/Final Project/3220-Final-Project/2025 County Health Rankings Virginia Data - v3.xlsx"

excel_sheets(file_path)

measure_df <- read_excel(file_path,
                         sheet = "Select Measure Data",
                         .name_repair = "unique") |>           
              clean_names()                                   
addl_df   <- read_excel(file_path,
                         sheet = "Additional Measure Data",
                         .name_repair = "unique") |>
              clean_names()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
addl_df <- addl_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(county) & county != "NA")  
summary(addl_df$life_expectancy)
ggplot(addl_df, aes(x = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", colour = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Life Expectancy Across Virginia Counties (2025)",
       x     = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       y     = "Number of Counties") +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
